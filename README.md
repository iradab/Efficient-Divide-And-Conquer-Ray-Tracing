The final project for INF584 - Image Synthesis. Implementation of Efficient Divide and Conquer. 
Below are instruction on Windows. We assume CMake to be installed. On MS Windows, once CMake is executed, one can open the solution (.sln) file located in the build directory.


## Compiling

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

## Running 

```
MyRayTracer.sln
```
After the previous line, run in release mode in Visual Studio.

This will output a file named "output.ppm" by default, that can be visualized using InfraView on windows, Feh on linux or GIMP on any platform.
