# Efficient Divide-And-Conquer Ray Tracing using Ray Sampling

This project was a final project for INF584 - Image Synthesis course at Ecole Polytechnique de Paris. This project is implementation of the paper by K.Nabata [**Efficient Divide-And-Conquer Ray Tracing using Ray Sampling**] (http://nishitalab.org/user/UEI/publication/Nabata_HPG2013.pdf)


Below are instruction on Windows. We assume CMake to be installed. On MS Windows, once CMake is executed, one can open the solution (.sln) file located in the build directory.

## Compiling

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

## Running 

```
MyRayTracer.sln
```
After the previous line, run in release mode in Visual Studio.

This will output a file named "output.ppm" by default, that can be visualized using InfraView on windows, Feh on linux or GIMP on any platform.
